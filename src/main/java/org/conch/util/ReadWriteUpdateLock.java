 * obtains a lock that it already holds, it must release the lock the same number of times that it
 * obtained the lock.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>An attempt to obtain the read lock while another thread holds the write lock will cause
 * the thread to be suspended until the write lock is released.</li>
 * <li>An attempt to obtain the update lock while another thread holds the update or write lock
 * will cause the thread to be suspended until the blocking lock is released.  A thread
 * holding the update lock can subsequently obtain the write lock to gain exclusive access.
 * An attempt to obtain the update lock while holding either the read lock or the write lock
 * will result in an exception.</li>
 * <li>An attempt to obtain the write lock while another thread holds the read, update or write lock
 * will cause the thread to be suspended until the blocking lock is released.
