/**
 * The purpose of broadcast transaction is to support client side signing of transactions.
 * Clients first submit their transaction using {@link CreateTransaction} without providing the secret phrase.<br>
 * In response the client receives the unsigned transaction JSON and transaction bytes.
 * <p>
 * The client then signs and submits the signed transaction using {@link BroadcastTransaction}
 * <p>
 * The default wallet implements this procedure in nrs.server.js which you can use as reference.
 * <p>
 * {@link BroadcastTransaction} accepts the following parameters:<br>
 * transactionJSON - JSON representation of the signed transaction<br>
 * transactionBytes - row bytes composing the signed transaction bytes excluding the prunable appendages<br>
 * prunableAttachmentJSON - JSON representation of the prunable appendages<br>
 * <p>
 * Clients can submit either the signed transactionJSON or the signed transactionBytes but not both.<br>
 * In case the client submits transactionBytes for a transaction containing prunable appendages, the client also needs
 * to submit the prunableAttachmentJSON parameter which includes the attachment JSON for the prunable appendages.<br>
 * <p>
 * Prunable appendages are classes implementing the {@link Appendix.Prunable} interface.
