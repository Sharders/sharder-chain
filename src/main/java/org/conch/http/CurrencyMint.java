/**
 * Generate new currency units
 * <p>
 * Parameters
 * <ul>
 * <li>currency - currency id of the minted currency</li>
 * <li>nonce - a unique nonce provided by the miner</li>
 * <li>units - number of units minted per this transaction</li>
 * <li>counter - a sequential number counting the ordinal mint operation number per currency/account combination<br>
 * this ever increasing value ensures that the same mint transaction cannot execute more than once</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each minting request triggers a hash calculation based on the submitted data and the currency hash algorithm<br>
 * The resulting hash code is compared to the target value derived from the current difficulty.<br>
 * If the hash code is smaller than the target the currency units are generated into the sender account.<br>
 * It is recommended to calculate the hash value offline before submitting the transaction.<br>
 * Use the {@link GetMintingTarget} transaction to retrieve the current hash target and then calculate the hash offline
 * by following the procedure used in {@link org.conch.mint.CurrencyMint#mintCurrency}<br>
